# Go Basic
This repository provides the essential facilities for starting a Go project, allowing users to quickly initiate a new project.


## Directory Contents
In addition to the basic structure of a Go project, the following elements have been added:

- `bin/`: By default, this directory is used to store the binaries generated by `go build`. The name of the executable will be based on the last segment of the path defined in `go.mod` module. For example, for this project, the binaries name will be "seed"
- `.golangci.yml`: This file is used to configure the `golangci-lint` for code linting
- `Makefile`: Provides various recipes for building, executing, testing, and auditing the project

### .golangci.yml
Apart from the default 6 linters, several additional linters have been included. It is recommended to adjust the following settings for new projects:

- `run`
    - `skip-dirs`: Specify the directories that should be skipped by the linter. This is useful for ignoring content generated by code generators (e.g., `mockgen`)
    - `skip-files`: Specify the files that should be skipped by the linter. For instance, this can include files generated by `protoc` (e.g., `.pb.go` files)
- `linters-settings`
    - `govet`: The **printf** setting is used to indicate formatted output functions. You can add your custom functions here (e.g., `log.Infof`)
    - `goimports`: The **local-prefixes** setting allows you to specify the module path of the current project. When linting, this ensures that the path is treated as a separate block

> By default, goimports groups standard library imports separately from others. If **local-prefixes** is specified, it creates an additional grouping. However, `gofmt` does not support formatting in this style, so the separation needs to be handled manually

### Makefile
The Makefile provides several simple recipes:

- `$(BIN_DIR)/$(BINARY_NAME)`: The default recipe, which rebuilds the binaries only if the source files (SRC_FILES) have changed
- `run`: Executes the compiled binaries of the project
- `test`: Runs all tests
- `cover`: Runs all tests and generates coverage profile, calculating the overall coverage rate
- `audit`: Conducts code inspections, including module checksum checks, linting, and security vulnerability scans

> The coverage generated by `cover` may differ from what you expect. Go calculates coverage based on the presence or absence of tests for each file. If there are no tests, there will be 0% coverage reported for that file
